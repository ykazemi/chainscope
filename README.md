# Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization

To perform the external consistency analysis in our paper, we generate a dataset of pairs of comparative questions using a subset of the _World Model_ dataset ([Gurnee & Tegmark, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207)).

1. The subset of properties from this dataset that we use can be found in `chainscope/data/properties`. 
2. We use these properties to generate the questions programatically using `scripts/datasets/gen_qs.py`. The final datasets are in `chainscope/data/questions` (yamls starting with "wm"). A more detailed description of the datasets can be found [here](chainscope/data/questions/datasets.md).
3. We generate CoT responses for the models using `scripts/iphr/gen_cots.py`. The raw responses are in `chainscope/data/cot_responses`.
4.  We evaluate these responses using `scripts/iphr/eval_cots.py`, and the eval results are in `chainscope/data/cot_eval`.

# Restoration Errors

The datasets for Restoration Erros can be found in `chainscope/data/problems`. 
1. We generate responses using `scripts/restoration_errors/gen_cot_paths.py`. The raw responses are in `chainscope/data/cot_paths`. 
2. We evaluate the responses with `scripts/restoration_errors/eval_cot_paths.py`, and the eval results are in `chainscope/data/cot_path_eval`.

# Answer Flipping Follow-up (My Contribution) 

An independent follow-up study auditing the answer-flipping phenomenon on QwQ-32B traces: manually reclassifying the automatically flagged flips, testing whether an alternative answer interface (semantic/A-B/polarity framing) resolves the mismatch while holding the model's reasoning fixed, and localizing the effect via activation probing and patching.

See `flip_experiments/README.md`.
